# Robot Arm with five degree of freedom
designing a Robot arm with 5 degrees of freedom (DOF), allowing for highly versatile and precise movements.

## GUIDE :
- I have used OnShape to design the arm 
- I have designed a simple 5-degree of freedom (DOF) robot arm as a 3D model. This design focuses on fundamental movements and basic functionality, providing a solid foundation for future enhancements and applications.
## GRIPPER 
The project includes a three-finger gripper attachment for the robot arm. It securely grasps objects and is easy to attach to the object 
the gripper enhances the arm's functionality for tasks like picking and placing objects.
